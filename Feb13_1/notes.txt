In web applications, we can implement both

(i) Client-Side Scripting

	Enables you to access the application from the same system, No Network Traffic and Execution will be
faster

(ii) Server-Side Scripting

	Enables you to access the application from
the server...Network traffic is high a bit slower.

(i) Any intranet based application w.r.t. No 
Security, Please opt for client-side scripting

(ii) Any internet based application w.r.t. min.
security please opt for both client-side and 
server-side scripting

(iii) Any internet based application w.r.t. High
security please opt for server-side scripting.

Node JS is a cross platform runtime env, and library for running javascript applications outside the browser. 

used for creating server side and networking web applications. It is a open source and free to use

If you want to build any fast and scalable applications, then we need the help of node js. 

To create any real-time applications, NodeJs is
best. 

It provides library for javascript moduoles to 
implement web applications. 

Node Js = JavaScript Lib + Runtime Env. 

How to Write Simple Node Js Code : 
____________________________________

HTTP Status Codes : 


404 -> Not Found
200 -> Success 
403 -> Forbidden

How to Create a Node Js Web-Based APp
______________________________________

1) import the required modules

The first step we need to do in nodeJs is to 
import the relevant modules prefer http module
and store the instance into http variable. 

example : 

var http = require("http");

2) Create Server

You need to establish server which listen to clients
request similar to web server. 

3) Request and response 

Create a http request made by the client to the 
browser. 

http://localhost:8181/name="prasanna"?city="Hyderbad"

For working with files, we need

var fs = require("fs");

writeFile() : used to write data into the file, if the file already exists it overwrites, if the file does not exists, it creates a file. 

appendFile() : used to write data into file. If the file exists it adds new contents at end of file, if the file does not exists it creates file. 

http://localhost:8181

Can we pass values through URL 

yes that concept known as query stirng. 

If you want to pass values then after post give ? first and give any key name and value with = symbol. After that if you want to pass any other value give & symbol and key = value

Example : 

http://locahost:8181/?name=prasanna&city=hyderbad
then first query string is name and value is prasanna
second query string is city and value is Hyderabad
